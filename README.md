This project explores the relationship between earthquake intensity, distance from the epicenter, and estimated distances using visual data analysis techniques. We employ scatter plots and a heatmap-like visualization to convey the variations and patterns within the earthquake data.

## Visualizations

### Scatter Plot: Intensity vs. Actual Distance

The first visualization is a scatter plot that compares the earthquake intensity to the actual distance from the epicenter. 

- **X-axis**: Actual Distance (km)
- **Y-axis**: Intensity

This plot aims to show how the intensity of earthquakes varies with the distance from the epicenter.

### Scatter Plot: Intensity vs. Estimated Distance

The second visualization is similar to the first but compares the earthquake intensity to the estimated distance from the epicenter. 

- **X-axis**: Estimated Distance (km)
- **Y-axis**: Intensity

This plot allows us to compare actual and estimated distances in relation to the intensity of earthquakes.

### Heatmap-like Scatter Plot

The third visualization is a heatmap-like scatter plot where the color and size of the markers represent the intensity of earthquakes. Larger and darker markers indicate higher intensity, while smaller and lighter markers represent lower intensity.

- **X-axis**: Actual Distance (km)
- **Y-axis**: Intensity
- **Marker Size and Color**: Intensity

This innovative approach provides a quick visual assessment of earthquake intensity across different distances.

## Analysis

- The scatter plots provide a straightforward comparison between actual and estimated distances in relation to earthquake intensity.
- The heatmap-like scatter plot combines color and size dimensions to offer a deeper understanding of intensity distribution across distances.
- By examining these visualizations, we can observe patterns and discrepancies between estimated and actual measurements, as well as the distribution of earthquake intensity.

## Conclusion

Visual data analysis of earthquake intensity and distance offers insightful observations into the nature of earthquakes. The employed visualizations not only facilitate a direct comparison between different data aspects but also enhance our understanding of the underlying patterns within the data.
